## Tokamak Operation

Tokamaks are pulsed machine and its operation can be broken down to a few key stages.
Generally it goes:
1. Breakdown (ionizing the gas to get plasma) 
2. Ramp-up (get the plasma current and other parameters to increases in a stable manner)
3. Flat-top (plasma has reached desired parameters and needs to be kept constant for power generation) 
4. Ramp-down (The plasma is extinguished)

The first 2 steps involves the tokamak starting up.
To be more specific:
1. Vacuum Vessel (VV) is filled with gas
2. Plasma break-down (ions and electrons are separated using central solenoid)
3. Plasma burn-through (plasma is full ionised)
4. Plasma current ramp-up (heating the plasma to desired temperature and density)

### Plasma Breakdown

During plasma breakdown, it is essentially to minimise the loss rate.

Loss rate = velocity parallel to field / L 

L = connection length 

L ~ 1/4 * a_eff *  B_phi * R_null / B_z

- a_eff = radius of PF null region
- R_null = centre of PF null region
- B_phi = toroidal field (generated by TF coils)
- B_z = average stray field over the null

The goal is to:
- Minimize B_z 
- Maximize a_null

The goal is to ensure that the connection length is far greater than the ionization length (ionization length appears to
be an empirical-derived parameter) (see Electromagnetic Models of Plasma Breakdown in the JET Tokamak)
