## Tokamak Operation

Tokamaks are pulsed machine and its operation can be broken down to a few key stages.

Generally it goes:
1. Breakdown (ionizing the gas to get plasma)
2. Ramp-up (get the plasma current and other parameters to increases in a stable manner)
3. Flat-top (plasma has reached desired parameters and needs to be kept constant for power generation)
4. Ramp-down (The plasma is extinguished)

The first 2 steps involves the tokamak starting up.
To be more specific:
1. Vacuum Vessel (VV) is filled with gas
2. Plasma break-down (ions and electrons are separated using central solenoid)
3. Plasma burn-through (plasma is full ionised)
4. Plasma current ramp-up (heating the plasma to desired temperature and density)

## Relevant Simulation

### Plasma Transport Code
Verdict: Mostly likely Bout++ if we can't get METIS Code
- More research need to done to evaluate the suitability of each option before we dedicate time to either option.

- [METIS](https://www.google.com/search?channel=fs&client=ubuntu-sn&q=fusenet+metis)
  - Pro: More sophisticated and complete modelling based off CRONOS
  - Con: Requires us to ask for permission from author to get access
- [CRONOS](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0029-5515/50/4/043001)
    - Pro: Well established code base with alot of features
    - Con: CRONOS is a suite of code written in Fortran, Matlab and C++. Very scattered.
    - [CRONOS Code Outline](https://www.google.com/search?channel=fs&client=ubuntu-sn&q=fusion-magnetique+cronos+cronos_gb)
- [Bout++](https://bout-dev.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_docs/introduction.html)
    - C++ Framework for plasma fluid simulations in 3D curvilinear coordinates
    - Pro: Open Source Code
    - Con: Difficult to use as code is in C++. Is not specific to plasma transport / more general.
